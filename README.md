# MIJN CANDLES
This is front end storefront. The application allows shoppers to add and update the number items in their cart.

# How It's Made
Tech used: TypeScript, React, Bootstrap, Vite - I decided to build the app using vite instead of the regualar create-react-app because I  personally think it works better when writing typescript. I decided to use typescript, because it's a type based language which hels to reduce errors when coding. the different routing was created with react-router. Lastly,  I used react bootstrap to style the application.

# Optimizations
The app is at a working build however in the future it would be nice to

- create a back end application to track and monitor inventory
- allow users to sign up for an  email reminder list, as new items are added to the store
- Additionally it I would like to add a checkout component 


# Lessons Learned
    - I learned how to use react's currency formatter
    - I also finally stopped forgetting to define the types of the application variables! (yayyy!!!)
    - 
    

# Packages/Dependencies used
vite, typescript, react-bootstrap, react-router,
